# Frontend Practice: Cloning Famous Websites

Welcome to my frontend practice repository! 🎯

In this repo, I'll be improving my frontend development skills by **rebuilding famous websites from scratch** using modern web technologies. This is a hands-on way for me to sharpen my skills in **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, and **React**, while learning best practices in UI/UX design, layout structuring, and responsiveness.

## 💡 Purpose

The goal of this project is to:
- Practice and improve my frontend coding abilities
- Learn how popular websites are structured and styled
- Build pixel-perfect clones to enhance attention to detail
- Explore modern tools and design techniques

## 🔧 Technologies I’ll Be Using

- HTML5
- CSS3 / Tailwind 
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- React
- Git & GitHub


*✅ Progress will be updated as I complete each clone.*

## 📁 Structure

Each project will be in its own folder with a clean codebase and responsive design.
